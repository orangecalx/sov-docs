Input signals are compared to the tunable internal VCO of the IC,and depending on their compatibilty are mangled in a way that ostensibly is similar to a tradiational ring modulator circuit. Sovereign is as much a sound effector as it is a sound generator , living comfortably between the two arbitrarily binary classes. SPECIFICATIONS 1590-style aluminum enclosure. Uses 9v center NEGATIVE power adapter, standard pedal jack. Batteries not supported currently. \u00bc\u201d input and output. CONTROLS TUNE PLL comparison oscillator control. Ranges from tremolo-range to khz audio. STARVE Reduces voltage to main PLL chip. Interesting effects. This one is important. FILTER (Very) low pass filter. Left is LOW, right is HIGH. Wide range for rumbly drones. MODE (switch) Selector between EMIT mode (feedback loop, output connect back to input) or standard EFFECT mode (incoming audio is effected and output). TIPS / TRICKS At the lower extremes, the Sovereign acts more like a very choppy tremolo, slightly reactive to input amplitude. In EMIT mode, a high enough STARVE setting results in strange sequenced noises. try to replicate the sound in your head on the Sovereign. The FILTER has a purposely wide lower cutoff range. try to turn the Sovereign into a strange drone synth. There\u2019s a certain setting that we can\u2019t talk about here. We can\u2019t say any more right now. CONTACT + SUPPORT Please do not hesitate to reach out to us with questions, comments, repair requests, returns, parables, assembly opcodes, and general support.

This covers manufacturing + assembly issues. Incorrect power connections (power supplies with wrong polarity, too much power, etc), wear and tear from normal use, and issues due to modifications are not covered by said Warranty (although you should absolutely email us with any mods you do). We will repair, replace, or refund depending on the circumstances. Shipping will be paid by the buyer.","title":"USER GUIDE"},{"location":"#summary","text":"Sovereign is a phase-locked loop \"pedal\" / \"effect\" / \"sound generator\", based off a DTMF (dial tone multi-frequency) tone decoder IC by Phillips Semiconductors.
